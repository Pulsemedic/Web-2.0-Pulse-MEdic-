Internet social networking tools and the emerging web 2.0 technologies are providing a new way for web users and health workers in information sharing and knowledge dissemination. Web networking tools have been utilized as a solution in emergency response during disasters. 

We use the use of internet social networking in disaster emergency response and public health management of disasters  and emergency care.

Internet social networking and mobile technology were found to be helpful for community residents, professional emergency rescuers, and government agencies in gathering and disseminating real-time information, regarding volunteer recruitment and relief supplies allocation. 

Healthcare is a complex system that works much like human biology. It is vast, difficult to change, and designed to survive and evolve. Unlike a biological system, however, it's artificial and can be changed relatively quickly when there's a compelling reason to do so.

Companies succeed in the big data era not simply because they have more or better data, but because they have leadership teams that set clear goals, define what success looks like, and ask the right questions. 

As senior clinical staff doctors and nurses we are able to communicate and effectively give you that service. .

Over the next decade healthcare will look very different from the way it's looked for the last 30 years. Changing market forces, rising consumer demands, and technology -- particularly digitization -- will create a radical shift in how and where healthcare services are delivered.
